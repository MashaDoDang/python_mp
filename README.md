# Weather Data Application

## Project Overview

This project is a Weather Data Application developed using Python and various libraries including Tkinter for the graphical user interface, Requests for API calls, SQLite for database management, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The application allows users to fetch, store, and visualize weather data for different cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project was created as the final mini project for the Script Languages course, completed in June 2024.

## Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Retrieve current hourly weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Store Data**: Save the fetched weather data into a local SQLite database.
- **Display Data**: Visualize the stored weather data using Matplotlib charts.
- **Database Management**: Clear all stored weather data from the database.
- **User Customization**: Change the background color, font, and text color of the application interface.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database operations and API calls.
- **Average Temperature Calculation**: Compute and display the average temperature from the stored data.

## Skills Gained

- **API Integration**: Learned how to interact with third-party APIs, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API, to fetch weather data.
- **Database Management**: Gained experience with SQLite for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in a database.
- **Data Visualization**: Used Matplotlib to create and display charts within a Tkinter application.
- **GUI Development**: Developed a user-friendly interface using Tkinter, including custom menus and dialog boxes.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling to manage exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to users.
- **Python Programming**: Enhanced Python programming skills, including working with libraries such as Requests, SQLite3, and Tkinter.
